Introductory tutorial creating a narrative to the RStudio's tutorial and other documentation for newbies to R's wonderful package shiny.

For more context about this tutorial, please see here: http://robinlovelace.net/r/2015/01/22/practical-introduction-shiny.html

And one application I'm thinking of using Shiny for:  https://github.com/Robinlovelace/pct

Will be interested to see what applications people create using shiny, especially if they're for the greater good!
